CI/CD pipeline checks for these, it is recommended that these tests are run during development before pushing changes.

```sh
make standards
```

`make standards` will:

- run `bandit` to check for common vulnerabilities in package code.
- run `safety` to check for vulnerabilites in 3rd party packages used.

## Documentation
To prevent unnecessary triggers of github-actions, github-pages will only be built and deployed on changes to the [main](https://github.com/samule-i/droppii/tree/main) branch, changes on feature branches should make implementation and documentation changes in parallel.

It is recommended that you use `mkdocs serve --config-file=docs/mkdocs.yml` to preview the generated mkdocs site and ensure that the changes render correctly.
  
Documentation is currently hosted using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) as a static website generated by [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
